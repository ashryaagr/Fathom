# Fathom — user-instruction backlog

Every item below is an instruction the user gave that I acknowledged but
deferred in favor of shipping something else. In order received. Executed
top-to-bottom until the list is empty.

## 1. Micro-affordance animations — ✅ DONE (commit below)
- Browser-style arrow animation on two-finger swipe back/forward.
  - Swipe right (back) → arrow sweeps left-to-right pointing ← at left edge.
  - Swipe left (forward) → mirror.
- Visual zoom-commit flash when ⌘ is released and a lens actually opens.
- Subtle on-screen cue when ⌘ is held to arm semantic mode (beyond the
  existing armed-ring).
- Hint when Esc is pressed inside a lens (Esc intentionally doesn't close
  anymore; show the user what DOES close).

## 2. Visual-only coach redesign — ✅ DONE
The current CoachHint is text-heavy. User's explicit principle: *"no one
reads words to learn how to set up."*
- Replace each step's headline+body with a pictogram + one short label.
- Gate each step on the user actually doing it in a marked practice
  section, not just on a global event.
- Skip-with-confirmation: first skip press shows a warning that Fathom has
  controls that aren't discoverable by word; second press confirms.

## 3. Streaming-narrative coach copy — ✅ DONE
Inside a lens, while Claude is streaming, the coach should update to
"Claude is reading the paper for you. Ask any follow-up in the box below
any time." — narrative, not instructional.

## 4. Better sample PDF — ✅ DONE
Current sample is a hand-written 2-pager. User asked for a real short
workshop paper with figures (real research-looking content). Find a
redistributable short paper or generate a richer synthetic one with
SVG-rendered figures.

## 5. Mid-stream drill safety — ✅ DONE
When a lens is streaming, selecting text and ⌘-pinching sometimes doesn't
drill (selection cleared by DOM re-render, or Range disconnected). Guard
`getBoundingClientRect()` on the snapshot; fall back to a viewport-center
rect; log why the capture failed when it does.

## 6. Recursive drill context — ✅ DONE
When drilling, pass not just the parent body but the full parent chain
(parent's parent, etc.) as context so Claude can trace the lineage
of what the reader is diving into.

## 7. UpdateToast renderer UI — ✅ DONE
Auto-updater runs silently today. Add the promised toast that says
"Version X is ready — Restart to install" with a button, so the user
can trigger `quitAndInstall` proactively instead of waiting for the next
quit.

## 8. Suppress visual zoom during ⌘+pinch — ⛔ REVERTED (was wrong — visual zoom during ⌘+pinch is what lets the user aim at the target before committing. Restored to the original behaviour.)
Currently the page still visually zooms while ⌘ is held — contributes to
the mixed-gesture confusion. Semantic mode should NOT visually zoom;
reserve visual zoom for plain pinch only. (Direction-accumulation fix
already landed; this is the second half.)

## 9. Marker reliability after Back-button close — ✅ DONE (code audit: back/closeAll never touch cache; z-index/position fix from commit 2a22d4e addresses the display side)
Verify the amber marker actually appears next to the paragraph after the
user closes the lens via the Back button (not just after a swipe). Log
the cache-population path if any miss.

## 10. Intel DMG
One config flag. Ship `dist:mac-intel` alongside arm64 if the demand
warrants.

## 11. Apple Developer signing (blocked on user)
Not actionable until user enrolls in the Developer Program + provides
Developer ID cert + app-specific password. When those land: flip
`mac.identity`, enable `hardenedRuntime`, add notarize config, add CI
env-vars.

## Re-audit (from user re-asking what else I skipped)

- [x] **Highlighter tool** — ✅ DONE.
      - Schema: additive `highlights` table (id, paper_hash, page,
        rects_json, text, color, created_at) with paper-page index.
      - Repo: `Highlights.insert / byPaper / delete`.
      - IPC: `highlights:save`, `highlights:delete`; `paper:state` now
        returns `highlights` alongside regions/explanations.
      - Renderer: `useHighlightsStore` (id map + paper-page secondary
        index) and `HighlightLayer.tsx` rendering amber rects under the
        text layer via `mix-blend-mode: multiply`.
      - Entry points: ⌘H keyboard shortcut OR marker icon in the header.
        Both invoke `createHighlightFromSelection` which converts DOM
        client rects to PDF user-space, buckets by page, writes through
        to SQLite, and clears the selection as visual confirmation.
      - Click a highlight → confirm → delete.
      - Hydrated on PDF open; rects in PDF user-space so they survive
        zoom changes and re-opens.
      - v1 is amber-only; palette TBD in a follow-up.

- [x] **Visible drop zone in the empty state** — ✅ DONE in the same commit
      as this todo edit. Dashed-border centered drop target, brightens on
      drag-over, plus "Or pick from a folder" button at the bottom.

## 12. Auto-update rearchitected around install.sh — ✅ DONE
Ad-hoc signing can't satisfy Squirrel.Mac's code-requirement matching.
Rather than translate the error, we replaced Squirrel entirely: the
same `install.sh` that powers the terminal first-install also powers
in-app updates. One script, one code path, works indefinitely with
ad-hoc signing, no Apple Developer fee. See `docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`.

## 13. Agent harness (CLAUDE.md + skills) — ✅ DONE
- `CLAUDE.md` committed to the repo (removed from `.gitignore`); section
  §0 encodes the working rules (every instruction executed, deferred
  ones to todo.md, end-to-end verify shipping paths, agent harness as
  first-class artifact, UX-review on controls change).
- `.claude/skills/` has three skills:
  - `fathom-e2e-test.md` — keyboard-gesture-driven E2E test loop.
  - `fathom-release.md` — build → sign → publish → verify 1→N+1 update.
  - `fathom-ux-review.md` — design-pattern checklist for controls changes.
- No coding-specific agents.

## 14. UX design-pattern review agent — ✅ DONE
Shipped as `fathom-ux-review.md` skill. Lists 10 checks covering gesture
direction, no-op feedback suppression, platform conventions, affordance
visibility, copy, agent-testability.

## 15. Swipe-vs-pan distinction — ✅ DONE
Swipe handler now early-returns when there's no lens focused and no
history — horizontal wheels become normal PDF scrolls. Chevron only
fires when action has effect. Horizontal-dominance filter bumped from
×1.4 to ×1.6 to reject near-diagonal pinches that leaked through.

## 16. Local CLAUDE.md discipline rule — ✅ DONE
Added §0 to the project CLAUDE.md with the user-instruction-discipline
rule plus end-to-end-verify, agent-harness, and UX-review rules.

## 17. First-paint PDF render speed — ✅ DONE
- `rootMargin` bumped 600px → 2000px (~3 viewports of prefetch).
- Added `renderedZoomRef` guard so scrolling in/out of viewport at the
  same zoom no longer tears the canvas back to "Rendering…"; only zoom
  changes trigger re-render.

## 18. Two-install-path distribution — ✅ DONE
DMG + `curl | bash` both supported. Both produce the same `Fathom.app`.
Updates funnel through the in-app updater that spawns install.sh
internally. Documented in `README.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md`, and
`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`.

## 19. Handwritten font across docs — ✅ DONE
Expanded Excalifont from hero-only to the body + all headings on the
docs site. Nav, tables, code, footer stay sans-serif for scan-ability
(handwriting in those hurts more than it helps).
